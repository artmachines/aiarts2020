## Major (technical setup) updates in Spring 2020: 

I. **Programming Language**: Mix runwayML + processing and Keras + plaidML, while F19 was using ml5js + tensorflow.keras:
  1. use [runwayML](https://runwayml.com/) (through the 14 weeks learning)
  2. use [Processing(Java)](https://processing.org/) to communicate with runwayML (for productive purpose)
  3. use Processing(Java) to code simple neural networks (week 03, 04)
      * 1. to practice Processing programming
      * 2. to open the black box of neural networks
  4. use [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [plaidML](https://github.com/plaidml/plaidml) backend to use AMD GPU support on macOSX (week 04 - week 08)
      * 1. to open the black box of neural networks 
      * 2. to learn the workflow of setup a ML project
      * 3. to learn Keras (not required learning objective)

II. **Training**: experiment with RunwayML and Colab to train while F19 was using Intel DevCloud:
  1. use [Jupyter notebook(https://jupyter.org/)] as IDE
  2. consider [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) for training (TBA)
