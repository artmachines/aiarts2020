## Artificial Intelligence Arts
### Spring 2020, at IMA, NYU Shanghai
* Course Website: https://wp.nyu.edu/shanghai-ima-aiarts/
* Instructor: [Aven Le Zhou](https://www.aven.cc/)
* Class Schedule: 2:45 - 5:45 PM, Mondays

### Previous version: Fall 2019
* [Artificial Intelligence Arts](https://github.com/aaaven/aiarts2019).
* with ml5js and tensorflow.keras

#### Major updates in Spring 2020: Mix runwayML (+ processing) and Keras (+ plaidML backend)
1. use [runwayML](https://runwayml.com/) (through the 14 weeks learning)
2. use [Processing(Java)](https://processing.org/) to communicate with runwayML (for productive purpose)
3. use Processing(Java) to code simple neural networks (week 03, 04)
    * 1. to practice Processing programming
    * 2. to open the black box of neural networks
4. use [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [plaidML](https://github.com/plaidml/plaidml) backend to use AMD GPU support on macOSX (week 04 - week 08)
    * 1. to open the black box of neural networks 
    * 2. to learn the workflow of setup a ML project
    * 3. to learn Keras (not required learning objective)
5. use [Jupyter notebook(https://jupyter.org/)] as IDE
6. consider [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) for training (TBA)
